Of course, you can always commit your changes more often than that, if you wish.  It can be good to get into a habit of committing your changes any time you make a significant modification, or when you stop working on the project for a bit.\n",

The tasks listed above have been designed to work with (virtually) any dataset. For folks that have recently taken 201 and used a dataset for their final project, you may want to consider using it for this assignment. \n",
