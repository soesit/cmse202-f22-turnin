    "# CMSE 202 Final (Fall 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this final is to give you the opportunity to test out some of the skills that you've developed having now finished CMSE 202. In particular, you'll be committing and pushing repository changes to a GitHub repository, working with data to build a network graph, performing regression analysis, and classifying data using a machine learning classifier. You should find that you have all of the skills necessary to complete this exam having completed the second half of CMSE 202!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to look through the entire exam before you get started so that you can appropriately budget your time and understand the broad goals of the exam. Once you've read through it, you'll probably want to make sure you do Part 1 first to ensure that your GitHub repository is working correctly. Let your instructor know right away if you run into issues!\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam is set up so that even if you get stuck on one part there are opportunities to get points on the other parts, so consider jumping ahead if you feel like you aren't making progress and then come back later if you have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions during the exam, you may ask the instructor, the TA, or the LA privately. If you are attending in-person, simply raise your hand and one of us will come over to you. If you are attending via-Zoom, please use the ask-for-help feature or privately message the instructor, the TA, or the LA. We will make any announcements or exam clarifications/corrections to the class via the following Google Document.\n",
    "\n",
    "[LINK]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note about using online resources**: This exam is \"open internet\". That means that you can look up documentation, google how to accomplish certain Python tasks, etc. Being able to effectively use the internet for computational modeling and data science is a very important skill, so we want to make sure you have the opportunity to exercise that skill. **However**: The use of any person-to-person communication software is absolutely not acceptable. If you are seen accessing your email, using a chat program (e.g. Slack), or any sort of collaborative cloud storage or document software (e.g. Google Documents other than the one we will make announcements on), you will be at risk for receiving a zero on the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep your eyes on your screen!** This exam is designed to give *you* the opportunity to show the instructor what you can do and you should hold yourself accountable for maintaining a high level of academic integrity. If any of the instructors observe suspicious behavior, you will, again, risk receiving a zero."
